# Console-Maker
A video game about making consoles. Has minigames even though it technically is one! Programmed by dual-core with only about 600 lines of code.

## The Game
Console Maker involves building consoles for clients through a series of minigames. It was designed for casual players who want an easy game. The current version of the game is **1.0.2**, which brought simple changes. This is the final version of the game, and no more updates will be released.

## The Code
Honestly, I couldn't decide how I wanted to program the game at first. Should I use an engine? What programming language do I want to use? Eventually, I decided: Blitz Studio was named after **Blitz BASIC**, so I'll use that. It was not an enjoyable experience (I dislike BASIC), and I kept throwing away code and redoing it. After many weeks of doing this, I was tired of developing the game and rushed to the finish line, writing the 608 lines of code in only 3 days (technically 2 1/2 days).

## The Aftermath
After the code was done, the game was posted to Blitz Studio's website (https://blitzstudio.net) and its Game Jolt page. There were two patches (made obvious by the version number), and then I was done programming the game. I was disappointed with how it turned out, but that's my fault. After taking a break, it was time to move on to the next project.
